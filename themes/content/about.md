Hi! I'm Deepesh Nathani and welcome to my little corner of the internet. I am currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science from New York University.

I am using this blog to document my journey through Machine Learning and Deep Learning. This also gives me an opportunity to code lots of new stuff.
