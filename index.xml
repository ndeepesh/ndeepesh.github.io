      <description>Recently, I came across an interesting non-linear visualization or dimensionality reduction method - tSNE(Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding). Here is the original paper describing the method in much more detail. I thought i&amp;rsquo;ll implement this from scratch. In this post I am sharing the code with extensive comments :)
Before moving onto the code, here is a brief overview of how it works. tSNE is just like PCA where you can reduce the dimensionality of data to 2 or 3 dimensions to visualize it.</description>

      <description>Note: All the code here is also available in this notebook. Variable names will be different in notebook then here. 
In this blog post we&amp;rsquo;ll talk about how different flavours of Gradient Descent help improve convergence of a function. Rosenbrock Function was taken for this experiment. It is a non-convex function, the one that we encounter regularly as Cost Functions in machine learning problems. Rosenbrock Function(Source: Wikipedia)
 Rosenbrock Function: $C(x, y) = (a-x)^2 + b(y-x^2)^2$  For this experiment values of both a and b is 1 Minimum value of Rosenbrock function then is 0 at (1, 1) Gradient of Rosenbrock Function w.</description>

      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Deepesh Nathani and welcome to my little corner of the internet. I am currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science from New York University.
I am using this blog to document my journey through Machine Learning and Deep Learning. This also gives me an opportunity to code lots of new stuff.</description>
